# Advanced Prompt Generator with Vite React & Tailwind

This project is based on the [Advanced Prompt Generator](https://github.com/shpetimhaxhiu/advanced-prompt-generator) but made with Vite, React, and Tailwind. It includes more models and features both a Light and Dark theme. This is a simple yet powerful web application that allows users to interact with OpenAI's GPT-based language models through a convenient and user-friendly interface. Built using modern web technologies, it employs the [OpenAI API](https://beta.openai.com/) to generate AI responses, making it an excellent tool for generating advanced prompts and maximizing the potential of OpenAI models.
